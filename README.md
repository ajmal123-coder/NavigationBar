# HTML & CSS Navigation Bar

This is my first project where I created a simple and navigation bar using HTML and CSS that replicate W3School Navigation Bar. 
It demonstrates the basics of structuring and styling a navigation bar that can be customized further to fit the needs of any website.

## Features

- Simple, clean design
- Basic responsive functionality for mobile view
- Hover effects on navigation links
- Built with HTML and CSS

## Demo

You can preview the navigation bar by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the navigation bar.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file used to style the navigation bar.
